```
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        SwiftRater.daysUntilPrompt = 7
        SwiftRater.usesUntilPrompt = 10
        SwiftRater.significantUsesUntilPrompt = 3
        SwiftRater.daysBeforeReminding = 1
        SwiftRater.showLaterButton = true
        SwiftRater.debugMode = true
        SwiftRater.appLaunched()

        return true
    }

```

| Property      | Description           |
| :------------- |:-------------|
| daysUntilPrompt      | Shows review request if `daysUntilPrompt` days passed since first app launch. |
| usesUntilPrompt      | Shows review request if users launch more than `usesUntilPrompt` times.      |
| significantUsesUntilPrompt | Shows review request if user does significant actions more than `significantUsesUntilPrompt` |

You can set properties you want to apply.

| Property      | Description           |
| :------------- |:-------------|
| debugMode      | Shows review request every time. Default false, **need to set false when you submit app to AppStore**. |
| showLaterButton | Show Later button in review request dialong, valid for iOS10.2 or before devices.|
| daysBeforeReminding | Days until reminder popup if the user chooses `rate later`,  valid for iOS10.2 or before devices.      |

2.Call `SwiftRater.check()` in `viewDidAppear` of ViewController where you want to show review request dialog. If conditions are met, SwiftRater will show review request popup.

```
    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        SwiftRater.check()
    }

```

3(Optional).For `significantUsesUntilPrompt`, you need to add `SwiftRater.incrementSignificantUsageCount` in siginificant action for your app.

```
func postComment() {
    // do something ..

	SwiftRater.incrementSignificantUsageCount()
}

```

4(Optional).Call `SwiftRater.rateApp()` to let your users to review your app on the App Store/in your app directly.

```
func rateButtonDidClick(sender: UIButton) {
    // do something ..

	SwiftRater.rateApp()
}

```

## Example

This example states that the rating request is only shown when the app has been launched 5 times and after 7 days, remind 5 days after if later selected.

```
SwiftRater.daysUntilPrompt = 7
SwiftRater.usesUntilPrompt = 5
SwiftRater.daysBeforeReminding = 5
SwiftRater.appLaunched()
```

If you wanted to show the request after 5 days only and remind 7 days after if later selected, you can set the following:

```
SwiftRater.daysUntilPrompt = 5
SwiftRater.daysBeforeReminding = 7
SwiftRater.appLaunched()
```
